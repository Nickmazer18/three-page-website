      I ran into mulitple problems while constructing this page. At first I was frustrated, but
      I realized that nothing would get done if I just gave up. Reading and researching helped me gain a better
    understanding of what is necessary to make a webpage actually work.</p>
      <br>
    <p>With the help of my great instructors Bj and Oggi this webpage went from an idea to a reality.

    <p><strong>Thanks for taking the time to check out my first page. Better things are to come!</strong></p>
