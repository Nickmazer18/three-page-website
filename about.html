        Hello Everyone. My name is Nick Mazer and I am 25 years old. I started coding in college and didn't realize how much I actually enjoyed doing this until I started working a job with little creativity. Although it is troubling and sometimes really difficult,
        I really enjoy the challenges it gives me and the gratification I get when I accomplish them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>I wish this came more naturally! All good things don't come easy!</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>I am new to this so cut me some slack.</b> I ran into mulitple problems while constructing this page. At first I was frustrated, but I realized that nothing would get done if I just gave up. Reading and researching helped me gain a better understanding
        of what is necessary to make a webpage actually work.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the help of my great instructors Bj and Oggi this webpage went from an idea to a reality.
        Now this webpage really isn't anything special but over time I feel confident that I will be able to
        create better projects.
      </p>


      <p>
        <strong>Thanks for taking the time to check out my first page. Better things are to come!</strong>
