    <h1> About Me </h1>



    <p>Hello Everyone. My name is Nick Mazer and I am 25 years old. I started coding in college<br> and didn't realize how much I actually enjoyed doing this until I started working a job with<br> little creativity. Although it is troubling and sometimes
      really difficult, I really enjoy the <br> challenges it gives me and the gratification I get when I accomplish them.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>I wish this came more naturally! All good things don't come easy!</strong></p>

    <p><b>I am new to this so cut me some slack.</b><br>
      <br> I ran into mulitple problems while constructing this page. At first I was frustrated, but I realized that nothing would get done if I just gave up. Reading and researching helped me gain a better understanding of what is necessary to make a
      webpage actually work.</p>
    <br>
    <p>With the help of my great instructors Bj and Oggi this webpage went from an idea to a reality.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Thanks for taking the time to check out my first page. Better things are to come!</strong></p>
